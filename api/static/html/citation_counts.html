<p>Citation numbers alone do not accurately reflect research quality or impact
but are helpful to understand usage patterns and scholarly attention. These
 metrics supplement, rather than replace, other evaluative activities such as
peer review, qualitative assessment, and expert judgment.<p>

<p>Multiple sources are included because each academic database follows
different methodologies for gathering and counting citations. This variation
occurs because databases:
<ul>
<li>Index different sets of journals, books, and publications</li>
<li>Use different methods to extract and verify citations</li>
<li>Cover different time periods and geographic regions</li>
<li>Apply varying quality control standards</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Understanding these differences helps researchers make informed decisions
about which metrics best serve their specific needs. Note many of these
aggregators reference each other as data sources.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://webofscience.help.clarivate.com/en-us/Content/all-times-cited-counts.html" target="_blank">Web of Science</a>: Counts citations only from journals, books, and conference
proceedings indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection (approximately
21,000+ hand-selected, peer-reviewed sources). Citations are extracted from
reference lists of indexed publications and linked algorithmically. Does not
count citations from books, dissertations, patents, or technical reports
outside their indexed collection. Self-citations and duplicate citations from
the same source article are excluded.</li>
<li><a href="https://dimensions.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/23000018849-where-are-citations-in-dimensions-coming-from-)" target="_blank">Dimensions</a>: Extracts citations from multiple sources including Crossref,
PubMed Central, OpenCitations data, and directly from full-text records
provided by publishers. Coverage extends beyond journal articles to include
books, conference proceedings, preprints, and links to grants, clinical
trials, and patents. This broader approach typically results in higher
citation counts compared to more restrictive databases.</li>
<li><a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/16afe6ec/update-on-elife-s-indexing-status-at-web-of-science" target="_blank">eLife</a>:
Aggregates citations across multiple versions of the same work using
"umbrella DOIs" that link together different publication versions. This
includes citations to both the peer-reviewed preprints and the final version
of record, capturing early-stage citations that occur before final
publication. This version-linking approach provides a more comprehensive
impact measurement by avoiding citation splitting across different versions of
the same research, though it may result in higher citation counts compared to
traditional databases that treat each version separately. This information is
found at the end of every publication under "Metrics."</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.openalex.org/additional-help/faq" target="_blank">OpenAlex</a>: Aggregates citation data from multiple sources including
Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG), Crossref, web crawls, and institutional
repositories. Uses automated extraction and machine learning for citation
matching and author disambiguation. Provides comprehensive, open-access
coverage with data licensed under CC0, making it freely redistributable.</li>
<li><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/help/" target="_blank">PubMed</a>: PubMed itself does not generate citation counts. Pubmed is a
bibliographic database containing abstracts and publication information.
Citation data for PubMed articles must be obtained from external sources.
PubMed serves primarily as a discovery tool for biomedical literature, with
citation analysis typically performed using other databases that index PubMed
content.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/faq" target="_blank">Semantic Scholar</a>: Uses AI-powered extraction from publisher partnerships,
web indexing, and public sources. Automatically identifies citing papers and
employs machine learning to classify citation types (background, methods,
results) and identify "highly influential citations." Focuses on semantic
analysis beyond simple citation counting, though coverage may be more limited
than comprehensive databases.</li>
